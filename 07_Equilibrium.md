# Equilibrium

## 7.1 Introduction to Equilibrium

When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentration or partial pressures of all species remain constant. The equilibrium state is dynamic, the forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. 

Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. 

## 7.2 Direction of Reversible Reactions

If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products or reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal.

## 7.3 Reaction Quotient and Equilibrium Constant

The reaction quotient $Q_c$ describes the relative concentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reactant quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as $Q_p$. The reaction quotient tends towards the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium, $K_c=Q_c$ and $K_p=Q_p$. As examples, for the reaction $aA+bB\rightleftharpoons cC+dD$ the equilibrium expression for ($K_c,Q_c$) is 
$$
K_c=\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}
$$
and that for ($K_p,Q_p$) is 
$$
K_p=\frac{(P_C)^c(P_D)^d}{(P_A)^a(P_B)^b}
$$

> Will not be assessed on the conversion between $K_c$ and $K_p$.
>
> Will not be assessed on equilibrium calculations on systems where a dissolved species is in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase.

The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids.

## 7.4 Calculating the Equilibrium Constant

Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements from the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium.

## 7.5 Magnitude of the Equilibrium Constant

Some equilibrium reactions have very large $K$ values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small $K$ values and barely proceed at all.

## 7.6 Properties of the Equilibrium Constant

When a reaction is reversed, $K$ is inverted. 

When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor $c$, $K$ is raised to the power $c$.

When reactions are added together, the $K$ of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the $K$’s for the reactions that were summed.

Since the expression for $K$ and $Q$ have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of $K$ also apply to $Q$.

## 7.7 Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations

The concentration or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial connections, and the appropriate $K$.

## 7.8 Representations of Equilibrium

Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant.

## 7.9 Introduction to Le Châtelier’s Principle

Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stress such as addition or removal of a chemical species., change in temperature, change in volume/pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system.

Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution.

### 7.10 Reaction Quotient and Le Châtelier’s Principle

A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes $Q$ to differ from $K$, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds to bringing $Q$ back into agreement with $K$, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state.

Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in $Q$ only. A change in temperature causes a change in $K$. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring $Q$ and $K$ back into equality.

## 7.11 Introduction to Solubility Equilibria

The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by $K_{sp}$ the solubility-product constant. The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the $K_{sp}$ for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. The solubility rules can be quantitatively related to $K_{sp}$, in which $K_{sp}$ values >1 corresponds to soluble salts.

## 7.12 Common-Ion Effect

The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved in a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or called from the $K_{sp}$ for the dissolution process.

## 7.13 pH and Solubility

The solubility of a salt is pH sensitive when one of the constituent ions is a weak acid or base. These effects can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle.

> Will not be assessed on computations of solubility of a function of pH.

## 7.14 Free Energy of Dissolution

The free energy change ($\Delta G^{\circ}$) for a dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors:

- The breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together
- The reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species
- The interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent

It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited.
